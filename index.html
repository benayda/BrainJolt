<p>Applying <a href="http://multipleintelligencesoasis.org/about/">the Theory of Multiple Intelligences</a>, developed by <a href="http://www.pz.harvard.edu/who-we-are/people/howard-gardner">Howard Gardner</a>, I have focused on reaching a wide range of adult learners by adapting the presentation of educational content to people with differing profiles of <a href="http://multipleintelligencesoasis.org/about/the-components-of-mi/">multiple intelligences</a>. Therefore, for my PhD dissertation, which I completed in 2002, I developed a prototype adaptive online learning system and performed a formative evaluation of the prototype. I tested the prototype with a wide range of adult learners, gathering feedback on how the prototype system could be improved so that online learning can offer "anyone, anyhow" learning in addition to providing "anytime, anywhere" access. My complete dissertation is available online: <a href="https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/73fa/83b623d4c0202c3779aed01e1c1357603716.pdf">Applying Multi-Intelligent Adaptive Hypermedia to Online Learning</a>, and many other educational technologists have cited and built on my research. Individual chapters are also available online: <a href="https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/ea99/bee7e12b22e98af18374532593973e9ac448.pdf">Overview of Research Study in Applying Multi-Intelligent Adaptive Hypermedia to Online Learning</a>, <a href="https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/06b8/50e22905dcfb47413cd42055b7d56ce45b8c.pdf"> Theoretical Foundation in Educational Psychology for Multi-Intelligent Online Learning</a>, <a href="https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/f347/c11560585c58e65bfe8e131bbeff27d73a7b.pdf?_ga=2.131822220.2017004569.1501477073-1850348714.1501477073">Adaptive Hypermedia Technology for Multi-Intelligent Online Learning</a>, and <a href="https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/8ad0/bbf71becb67b698a5f8e00c7217885d2e0c9.pdf?_ga=2.131357196.2017004569.1501477073-1850348714.1501477073">Web Technologies for Multi-Intelligent Online Learning</a>. </p>

<p>Serving as Curriculum Development Coordinator for the <a href="https://www.stanford.edu/">Stanford University</a> Western Institute of Computer Science (WICS), I organized and taught courses in Electronic Commerce and Web Business Development to professionals in industry, academia, and governmental agencies. Our courses were offered as face-to-face week-long intensive courses in the summer as well as online to organizations through the <a href="http://scpd.stanford.edu/home">Stanford Center for Professional Development</a>. I then worked with the University of Hong Kong to establish the first <href="https://www.ecom-icom.hku.hk/">Master's degree program in Electronic Commerce and Internet Computing</a> in the Asia Pacific region, accepting the first cohort in 1999. As part of the Master's degree program, I taught my E-Commerce and Web Business Development course as a hybrid in-person and online course to 127 working professionals. Prentice-Hall was interested in the Stanford Web Development curriculum I had developed with some of the other Stanford WICS faculty members, so I co-authored two books: <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Supporting-Web-Servers-Interactive-Workbook/dp/0130858994">Supporting Web Servers</a> and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Analyzing-Commerce-Internet-Interactive-Workbook/dp/0130858986">Analyzing E-Commerce and Internet Law</a>, which were published by Prentice-Hall in 2001. The books were adopted to help teach Web development and E-Commerce at a number of universities. Supporting Web Servers was subsequently translated into German and published for the German higher education market as well.</p>

<p>After I completed my PhD, I presented a summary of my dissertation at the <a href="https://www.aace.org/">Association for the Advancement of Computers in Education (AACE)</a> E-Learn 2002 conference in Montreal, Canada, and my paper: <a href="https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/55dc/4b9631624a7aa938b17121628a14cb4a1a39.pdf">Applying Multi-Intelligent Adaptive Hypermedia to Online Learning</a>, was published in the conference proceedings.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Meeting other e-learning researchers at E-Learn 2002, I co-founded an international e-learning collaboratory, The Montreal Band, and conducted action research with colleagues in Germany, the UK, Belgium, Mexico, and other parts of the U.S. The first paper that resulted from our collaborative action research was: <a href="https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/a717/fe6cda038ffe27b4bd8859a06b43a0a62532.pdf?_ga=2.257604488.2017004569.1501477073-1850348714.1501477073">A Model for Systemic Change Management in Education</a>, which I co-authored with Michael Bischoff, in Germany, and Marylu Menchaca, who had come from Mexico to work in Texas. Our paper was selected as the best paper presented in the session: Applications of Information & Communication Technologies in Education during the International Conference on Education and Information Systems: Technologies and Applications (EISTA Â´03), July 31-August 2, 2003 in Orlando, Florida. The Journal of Systemics, Cybernetics, and Informatics subsequently published <a href="http://www.iiisci.org/Journal/SCI/FullText.asp?var=&id=P706915">A Model for Systemic Change Management in Education</a> in Volume 2 - Number 1 - Year 2004. Later, our paper was translated into Portuguese to become a chapter in a book on e-learning in universities published by <a href="http://www.cengage.com/">Cengage Learning</a> for the Brazilian higher education market.<p>

<p>I collaborated with two other Montreal Band members, Ann Shortridge, in the U.S., and Toby De Loght, in Belgium, applying the Entry Point Framework I had learned from <a href="http://www.pz.harvard.edu/who-we-are/people/howard-gardner">Howard Gardner</a> and his Project Zero team at the Harvard University School of Education, to faculty development. We discussed our collaborative action research in a paper entitled: <a href="http://www.learntechlib.org/p/20473/">The Online Water Cooler: Inviting Faculty into Professional Development through the Entry Point Framework</a>, which we presented at <a href="http://www.learntechlib.org/search/?q=De+Loght&submit=Search">ED-MEDIA 2005--World Conference on Educational Multimedia, Hypermedia & Telecommunications</a> in Montreal, Canada. Ann, Toby, and I also co-authored a paper entitled: <a href="http://ascilite.org/archived-journals/e-jist/docs/vol9_no2/papers/current_practice/shortridge_deLoght_dara-ab.htm"> TNT-IDS: Showcasing an Educational Informatics Project Development Guide Prototype</a>, that was published in the e-Journal of Instructional and Technology (eJIST).
</p>
 
<p>I also collaborated with Leslie Shelton, who was applying <a href="http://multipleintelligencesoasis.org/about/">The Theory of Multiple Intelligences</a> to literacy training for adults. Leslie and I were asked to create an interactive training program for people working with adults in literacy training programs, and the program we developed was entitled: <a href="http://slideplayer.com/slide/6182163/">Unleashing Potential through Multi-Intelligent Literacy Instruction</a>.</p>

<p>As an adjunct faculty member at the University of San Francisco, I worked with other faculty members to develop online learning programs to accompany their courses in the Information Sciences program. I documented my experience developing problem-based online learning for adult learners and presented my paper entitled: xxx at the PEG2003 conference in July, 2003. I extended this work into a new virtual environment and presented a paper <a href="https://www.computer.org/csdl/proceedings/c5/2005/2325/00/23250119-abs.html">entitled: Reaching Adult Learners through the Entry Point Framework and Problem-Based Learning in a Croquet-Based Virtual Environment (abstract) </a>at the 2005 International Conference on Creating, Connecting, and Collaborating through Computing in Kyoto, Japan. The full paper is available here.</p>

<p>Santa Clara University was interested in helping their faculty learn how to use technology-enabled learning approaches to reach all different adult learners, so I developed and presented interactive workshops on <a href="https://studylib.net/doc/5441951/technology-enabled-learning--presentation-">Technology-Enabled Learning</a> and <a href="http://slideplayer.com/slide/8322801/">Educational Methodologies and Enabling Technologies</a> to a cross-section of faculty members in different departments.</p>

<p>After building and managing successful geographically-dispersed teams, I was asked to contribute to the Encyclopedia of Virtual Communities and Technologies, edited by Subhasish Dasgupta. I wrote a paper entitled: <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=I4excGQVTVkC&pg=PA422&lpg=PA422&dq=benay+dara-abrams+papers&source=bl&ots=Im9hpkic51&sig=3uznUxjJt7oVDqwV4A6yWSLximA&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjNir7i5bHVAhUF3YMKHfx6DPgQ6AEIYzAO#v=onepage&q=benay%20dara-abrams%20papers&f=false"> Success of Virtual Environments<a>. I also led workshops with my Montreal Band colleagues, on creating and managing successful distributed teams and on multi-intelligent online learning at <a href="https://www.fh-luebeck.de/en/">the University of Applied Sciences</a> in Luebeck, Germany and at the <a href="https://www.aace.org/conf/edmedia/future-past/">ED-MEDIA 2005</a>--World Conference on Educational Multimedia, Hypermedia & Telecommunicationsin Montreal, Canada.

<p>Recently, I have applied Data Science to e-learning to develop learning analytics, using Data Science tools for <a href="http://rstudio-pubs-static.s3.amazonaws.com/103853_38417065e3b74dd2b735815008b53545.html#/">Predicting Grades of Online Learners Based on Activity Indicators August, 2015</a>.

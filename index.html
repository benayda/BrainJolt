<p>Applying Howard Gardner’s Theory of Multiple Intelligences, my focus has been to reach a wide range of adult learners by adapting the presentation of educational content to people with different intelligence profiles. Therefore, for my PhD dissertation, which I completed in 2002, I developed a prototype adaptive online learning system and performed a formative evaluation of the prototype. I tested the prototype with a wide range of adult learners, gathering feedback for how it could be improved so that online learning can offer "anyone, anyhow" learning in addition to offering "anytime, anywhere" access. My entire dissertation is available online: <a href="http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.121.6804&rep=rep1&type=pdf">Applying Multi-Intelligent Adaptive Hypermedia to Online Learning</a>, and many other educational technologists have cited and built on my research. Individual chapters have been made available online as well: <a href="https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/06b8/50e22905dcfb47413cd42055b7d56ce45b8c.pdf"> Theoretical Foundation in Educational Psychology for Multi-Intelligent Online Learning</a> and <a href="http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.92.2209&rep=rep1&type=pdf">Web Technologies for Multi-Intelligent Online Learning</a>. </p>

<p>While I was working on my PhD, I served as Curriculum Development Coordinator for the Western Institute of Computer Science, organizing and teaching courses in E-Commerce and Web Business Development at Stanford University. Our courses were offered in-person and online as well. I then worked with the University of Hong Kong to establish a Master's degree programs in E-Commerce and Internet Computing. In addition, I taught my E-Commerce and Web Business Development course as a hybrid in-person and online course to 127 working professionals in the new Master's degree programs. Prentice-Hall was interested in the Stanford Web Development curriculum, so I co-authored two books: <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Supporting-Web-Servers-Interactive-Workbook/dp/0130858994">Supporting Web Servers</a> and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Analyzing-Commerce-Internet-Interactive-Workbook/dp/0130858986">Analyzing E-Commerce and Internet Law</a>, which were published by Prentice-Hall in 2001. Supporting Web Servers was translated into German and published in Germany as well.</p>

<p>After I completed my PhD, I presented a summary of my dissertation at the <a href="https://www.aace.org/">Association for the Advancement of Computers in Education (AACE)</a> E-Learn 2002 conference in Montreal, Canada, and my paper: <a href="https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/55dc/4b9631624a7aa938b17121628a14cb4a1a39.pdf">Applying Multi-Intelligent Adaptive Hypermedia to Online Learning</a>, was published in the conference proceedings.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Meeting other e-learning researchers at E-Learn 2002, I co-founded an international e-learning collaboratory, The Montreal Band, and conducted action research with colleagues in Germany, the UK, Belgium, Mexico, and other parts of the U.S. The first paper that resulted from our collaborative action research was: <a href="http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.136.9892&rep=rep1&type=pdf">A Model for Systemic Change Management in Education</a>, which I co-authored with Michael Bischoff and Marylu Menchaca. Our paper was selected as the best paper presented in the session: Applications of Information & Communication Technologies in Education during the International Conference on Education and Information Systems: Technologies and Applications (EISTA ´03), July 31-August 2, 2003 in Orlando, Florida. Our paper was subsequently published in: <a href="http://www.iiisci.org/Journal/SCI/FullText.asp?var=&id=P706915"> The Journal of Systemics, Cybernetics, and Informatics, Volume 2 - Number 1 - Year 2004</a>. Later, our paper was translated into Portuguese to become a chapter in a book on e-learning in universities published by Cengage Learning for the Brazilian education market.<p>
<p>I collaborated with two other Montreal Band members, Ann Shortridge, in the U.S., and Toby De Loght, in Belgium, applying the Entry Point Framework I had learned from Howard Gardner and his Project Zero team at Harvard University, to faculty development. We discussed our collaborative action research in a paper entitled: <a href="http://www.learntechlib.org/p/20473/">The Online Water Cooler: Inviting Faculty into Professional Development through the Entry Point Framework</a>, which we presented at <a href="http://www.learntechlib.org/search/?q=De+Loght&submit=Search">ED-MEDIA 2005--World Conference on Educational Multimedia, Hypermedia & Telecommunications</a> in Montreal, Canada. Ann, Toby, and I also co-authored a paper entitled: TNT-IDS: Showcasing an Educational Informatics Project Development Guide Prototype<a href="http://ascilite.org/archived-journals/e-jist/docs/vol9_no2/papers/current_practice/shortridge_deLoght_dara-ab.htm"> that was publishedin the e-Journal of Instructional Science and Technology (eJIST).
